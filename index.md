# About me

I am a Machine Learning Engineer. I am currently working at The Mall Cloud, the leading Intelligent Marketing company in USA. My primary interests are Computer
Vision, Deep Reinforcement Learning and Scaling ML Algorithms for various platforms. 

Apart from Technology, I like to read fanfictions, sing and play my guitar.

I am open to new opportunities. Feel free to drop me a line at kpgupta98@gmail.com.
